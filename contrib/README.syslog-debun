README for syslog-debun, the Syslog-ng DEBUg buNdle generator

The main purpose of this software is to collect and save information about
your syslog-ng installation / implementation for that case, if you want to
ask help about your syslog-ng related problem.

usage examples:
# syslog-debun -r
	Create a simple debug bundle, collecting about your environmental
	information. eg. list of packages, which contains the word: syslog
	ldd of your syslog-binary, etc.

# syslog-debun -r -l
	Like previuos, but left out some information, which may you think
	harm your privacy. Eg fstab, df's output, mount info, ip / network
	interface configuration, DNS resolv info, and process tree is NOT
	collected.

# syslog-debun -r -d
	Besides collecting information, it stops system's syslog-ng, then
	start in debug mode with -Fedv --enable-core, and until you do not
	press enter, it stays in that mode. Debug's output is collected into
	a separate file, and also collected.

# syslog-debun -r -p
	Will run packet capture with filter: "port 514 or port 601 or port 53"
	Also wait for pressing enter, like debug mode.

# syslog-debun -r -p -t 10
	Like the previous one, but do not wait for pressing enter, it will
	exit from tcpdump mode after 10 seconds. (noninteractive debug mode)

# syslog-debun -r -P "host 1.2.3.4" -D "-Fev --enable-core"
	packet capturing's filter will be changed from default to
		host 1.2.3.4
	Debugging paramters will be changed from default to
		-Fev --enable-core
	And, since a timout is not given, it will wait for pressing enter.

# syslog-debun -r -p -d -w 5 -t 10
	Collect pcap and debug mode output following this scenario:
	* start packet capture with default params
	* wait 5 seconds
	* stop system's syslog-ng
	* start syslog-ng in debug mode with default params, syslog's debug
	  messages are also appearing on your console
	* wait 10 seconds
	* stop syslog-ng debuging
	* start system's syslog-ng
	* stops packet capturing

# syslog-debun -r -W /var/tmp -P /usr/local
	Collect debug info, but the temporary files, and the result will be
	in /var/tmp instead of /tmp and don't try to search syslog-ng in
	/opt/syslog-ng, it will search in /usr/local

# syslog-debun -r -s -t 10
	Collect debug info, start tracing, and exit tracing after 10 seconds
